# Project Learn :star_struck:
Project Learn is a platform on which users share knowldge on topics. This is a project I have been building so as to practice web development with Django.

## How it works

- Users to create posts must have an account, therefore they signup
- Users login to access their accounts
- Each user has control over the posts they make (CRUD on posts)
- Each user can comment on other peoples' posts.
- All posts have tags basing on topic specified by the user

## Built With
- Django Web Framework
- Django Taggit (tagging functionality)
- Django Crispy Forms (for nice Looking forms)

## Get project source code 
The source code for the entire proect is [here](https://github.com/jod35/projectLearn).

So do a ` git clone https://github.com/jod35/projectLearn.git `

## Run code with
